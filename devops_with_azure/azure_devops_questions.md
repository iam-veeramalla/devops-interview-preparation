  **Answer:** Cloud computing is a model that allows users to access computing services like storage, servers, and applications over the internet, avoiding the need for on-premise infrastructure. It offers flexible deployment options: public clouds, where resources are shared, and private clouds, dedicated to one organization. Key benefits include scalability, reduced costs, and the ability to access resources on-demand, tailored to an organizationâ€™s specific needs.

  <summary>Q2. What are the different deployment models in cloud computing?</summary>
  
  **Answer:**

  - **Public Cloud**: In a public cloud, all resources are hosted on platforms like Azure, offering low cost and no need for hardware purchases or maintenance. It provides near-unlimited scalability, with resources available on demand, and high reliability due to a vast server network.
  
  - **Private Cloud**: Resources are dedicated to one organization, either on-premises or hosted by a third party. This model offers enhanced security and control since the infrastructure is private. It's ideal for companies needing more customized control over their data.
  
  - **Hybrid Cloud**: This model blends both public and private cloud features, allowing some components to run on-premises and others in the cloud. It provides flexibility by combining the scalability of the public cloud with the security of the private cloud.
